'''
The problem here is that @classmethod and @staticmethod donâ€™t actually create objects
that are directly callable. Instead, they create special descriptor objects, as described in
Recipe 8.9. Thus, if you try to use them like functions in another decorator, the decorator
will crash. Making sure that these decorators appear first in the decorator list fixes the
problem
