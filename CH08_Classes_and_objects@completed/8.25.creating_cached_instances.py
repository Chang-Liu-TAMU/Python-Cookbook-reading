 A WeakValueDictionary instance only holds onto the referenced
items as long as they exist somewhere else. Otherwise, the dictionary keys disappear
when instances are no longer being used. Observe:
'''
a = get_spam("a")
b = get_spam("b")
c = get_spam("c")
print(list(_spam_cache))
del a
del c
print(list(_spam_cache))
del b

Alternatively, if you want to give users a stronger hint that they shouldnâ€™t instantiate
Spam instances directly, you can make __init__() raise an exception and use a class
method to make an alternate constructor like this:
'''

class Spam:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        raise RuntimeError("Can't instantiate directly")
    # Alternate constructor
    @classmethod
    def _new(cls, name):
        self = cls.__new__(cls)
        self.name = name

import weakref

class CachedSpamManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
    def get_spam(self, name):
        if name not in self._cache:
            s = Spam._new(name) # Modified creation
            self._cache[name] = s
        else:
            s = self._cache[name]
        return s
