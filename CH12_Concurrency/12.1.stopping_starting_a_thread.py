The interpreter remains running until all threads terminate. For long-running threads
or background tasks that run forever, you should consider making the thread daemonic.
For example:

    t = Thread(target=countdown, args=(10,), daemon=True) 
    t.start()
'''

'''
Daemonic threads canâ€™t be joined. However, they are destroyed automatically when the
main thread terminates.

note:
    Due to a global interpreter lock (GIL), Python threads are restricted to an execution
model that only allows one thread to execute in the interpreter at any given time. For
this reason, Python threads should generally not be used for computationally intensive
tasks where you are trying to achieve parallelism on multiple CPUs. They are much
better suited for I/O handling and handling concurrent execution in code that performs
blocking operations (e.g., waiting for I/O, waiting for results from a database, etc.)
